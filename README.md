I definitely appreciate recursion more after this. You essentially get the left and right subtree for free, with some creative liberties taken on them to answer a specific question.

The theory for traversal for linked lists also apply here, and I simlarly used an interative approach when I couldn't envision the call stack.

I went with what was "easiest" in my head, but deletion was still by far the most tricky to implement even after understanding the theory behind two-child deletion.
